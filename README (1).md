# Project Title : To-do List Website
## Description
This is a simple to-do list website where users can add, delete, and mark tasks as completed or uncompleted. The tasks are saved in local storage so that they are retained even after a page refresh or user closes the browser. The HTML code creates the structure of the website, the CSS code styles the website, and the JavaScript code adds the dynamic functionality.

## Functionality
1) Users should be able to:
   - Add new tasks.
   - Edit existing tasks.
   - Delete tasks.
   - Mark tasks as completed or uncompleted.
2)  Local Storage: Tasks should be stored locally so that they are retained even if the user closes the browser.
3)  User Interface: Focus on improving the user interface for a seamless and intuitive user experience.
